	<title>CMIP5 data Terms of Use for Research Purposes Only</title>
	<body>

		These data are for use in research projects only.
		A 'research project' is any project carried out by
		an individual or organized by a university,
		a scientific institute, or similar organization
		(private or public) for non-commercial research
		purposes only. Results based on these data must be
		submitted for publication in the open literature
		without any delay linked to commercial objectives.

		In first making reference to the data obtained
		from the CMIP3 archive, please include the phrase
		"the World Climate Research Program's (WCRP's)
		Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3
		(CMIP3) multi-model dataset".
		Subsequent references within the same publication
		might refer to the data with terms such as
		"CMIP3 data", "the CMIP3 multi-model dataset",
		"the CMIP3 archive", or the "CMIP3 dataset".

		Whenever you publish research based on model
		output from the CMIP3 database, you should
		include the following acknowledgement:

		"We acknowledge the modeling groups for making
		their model output available for analysis,
		the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and
		Intercomparison (PCMDI) for collecting and
		archiving this data, and the WCRP's Working Group
		on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) for organizing the
		model data analysis activity. The WCRP CMIP3
		multi-model dataset is supported by the Office
		of Science, U.S. Department of Energy."

		[Note that the acronyms, WCRP and CMIP3, should
		have already appeared in the main text of your
		article, where they were presumably defined.]
