	<title>CORDEX terms of use for data limited to non-commercial research and educational purposes</title>
	<body>

[N.B.  If you plan to use your data for anything other than non-commercial research and 
educational purposes, you should register for the "CORDEX_Commercial" group, not this 
group.]

a) I agree to restrict my use of CORDEX model output for non-commercial research and
educational purposes only.
Results from non-commercial research are expected to be made generally available through open
publication and must not be considered proprietary.
Materials prepared for educational purposes
cannot be sold. These restrictions may only be relaxed by permission of the individual modelling
groups responsible for the simulations.

b) I will hold no individual(s), organization(s), or group(s) responsible for any errors in the models
or in their output data.

c) In publications that rely on the CORDEX model output, I will appropriately credit the data
providers by an acknowledgement similar to the following:
"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on
Regional Climate, and the Working Group on Coupled
Modelling, former coordinating
body of CORDEX and responsible panel for CMIP5. We
also thank the climate
modelling groups (listed in Table XX of this paper)
for producing and making available
their model output. We also acknowledge the Earth System Grid Federation
infrastructure an international effort led by the U.S. Department of Energy's Program for
Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison, the European Network for Earth System
Modelling and other partners in the Global Organisation for Earth System Science
Portals (GO-ESSP)."
where "Table XX" in your paper should list the models and modelling groups that provided the data
you used.

d) I acknowledge the potential limitations of the data obtained from this archive. These may include
(but are not necessarily limited to) errors in the models, shortcomings in the experiment designs, the
conjectural quality of the forcing scenarios used to drive the models, and statistical uncertainty of
model results.

e) I understand that although the model output has
been subjected to a quality control procedure,
unrecognized errors almost certainly remain.

f) To aid participating groups in understanding and
improving upon their models? behaviours, I will
respond to reasonable requests from the WGCM or from CORDEX data providers for feedback
about my CORDEX research results (e.g., reporting model deficiencies, recording CORDEX
publications, etc.).

g) I understand that Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs used, for example, in journal citations)
together with a citation reference will be assigned
to some of the CORDEX datasets during the
DataCite data publication process, and when available and as appropriate, I will cite CORDEX data
by these citation references in my publications.
