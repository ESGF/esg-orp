Initial distribution

1.1.0
Inclusion of new components for expanded flexibility:
	- FilterAuthorizationFilter as an alternative to the TDSAuthorizer
	- NoAuthorizationFilterCollaborator to bypass authorization
	
1.1.8
Enabled white listing of Identity Providers. 
	- Required manual configuration of OpenIDAuthenticationFilter in security context.

Moved retrieval and parsing of SAML authentication cookie from AuthorizationFilter to AuthenticationFilter.
	- Makes authentication process more self-consistent (also lowers the chance of getting order of filters wrong)
	- Requires the filter parameters "trustore" and "trustorePassword" to be set on the AuthenticationFilter instead of the AuthorizationFilter.
	- If the SAML authentication cookie is found and succesfully parsed, the use openid identity is saved at request scope as the value of
	  the attribute named "esg.openid" - can be retrieved by any downstream component including the metrics filter.

Insert experimental filter X509PreAuthenticationFilter
