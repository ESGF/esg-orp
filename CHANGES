1.1.0
Inserted capability of reading white list of trusted Identity Providers from local file.
The location of the file is specified in the Spring XML configuration, currently encoded as /esg/config/idpWhiteList.xml.
Every time the file is updated, the white list will be reloaded the first time it needs to be used.

1.0.5 
Modified Authorization Filter to query multiple endpoints, sequentially.
Added NOAA endpoints to white list.
Commenting out keystore location properties in esg-orp.properties
Updating dependency on esgf-security module.

1.0.4 Added PCMDI and ORNL ESGF nodes endpoints

1.0.3 Improved help text in login page to display redirect URL to user (http://esgf.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=38)

1.0.1
Change numbering schema again to start with 1.0 :-)
moved properties from WEB-INF/esg/orp/orp/config/application.properties to 
  WEB-INF/classes/esg-orp.properties
If properties not present or configured, try to parse CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml 
  retrieving the data from the first connector which is declared as secured.
auth filter: get's ORP certificate by connecting per SSL to the ORP (thus validating the certificate)
auth filter: Certificate is cached and check for expiration before being used.
auth filter: SAML cookie is cached along with other information (cookie validity dates)
  in the user session. Until the expiration date the cookie will be verbatim compared
  with that from the user session. If it's the same one, no further authentication
  takes place.


1.1.2.1
Changed numbering schema to start with datanode number.
Resolved warnings due to deprecated constructors in Spring Security package.
Renaming package from "esg.datanode.security" to "esg.orp".
Fixed HTTP parameter name ("openid_identifier") for automatic redirect from the ORP to the IdP, if present.

1.2.1
Migrated code to ESGF GIT repository, restructured to be compiled by Ivy
Updated dependencies on Spring and Tiles jars
Inserted AuthenticationByIPFilter to be used for LAS.

1.2.0
- Moved XML configuration files to ORP specific directory: esg/datanode/security/orp/config
- Moved application.properties to ORP specific directory: esg/datanode/security/orp/config
- Changed name of LOG output stream
- Introduced support for OpenID attribute exchange
    
1.1.9
Added BSD Open Source License license
Insert experimental filter X509PreAuthenticationFilter
    - Detects client X509 certificate and sets authorization flag (bypass redirection to ORP)
    - Only works for HTTPS requests
    - Must be inserted before AuthenticationFilter
    - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION

1.1.8
Enabled white listing of Identity Providers. 
    - Required manual configuration of OpenIDAuthenticationFilter in security context.

Moved retrieval and parsing of SAML authentication cookie from AuthorizationFilter to AuthenticationFilter.
    - Makes authentication process more self-consistent (also lowers the chance of getting order of filters wrong)
    - Requires the filter parameters "trustore" and "trustorePassword" to be set on the AuthenticationFilter instead of the AuthorizationFilter.
    - If the SAML authentication cookie is found and succesfully parsed, the use openid identity is saved at request scope as the value of
      the attribute named "esg.openid" - can be retrieved by any downstream component including the metrics filter.

1.1.0
Inclusion of new components for expanded flexibility:
    - FilterAuthorizationFilter as an alternative to the TDSAuthorizer
    - NoAuthorizationFilterCollaborator to bypass authorization

1.0.0
Initial distribution
