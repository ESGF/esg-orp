("obs4cmip5.NASA-JPL.AQUA.AIRS.mon.hus.1.aggregation.1") which is correctly restricted by the TDS

1.1.0

  WEB-INF/classes/esg-orp.properties
If properties not present or configured, try to parse CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml 
  retrieving the data from the first connector which is declared as secured.
auth filter: get's ORP certificate by connecting per SSL to the ORP (thus validating the certificate)
auth filter: Certificate is cached and check for expiration before being used.
auth filter: SAML cookie is cached along with other information (cookie validity dates)
  in the user session. Until the expiration date the cookie will be verbatim compared
  with that from the user session. If it's the same one, no further authentication
  takes place.

    - Makes authentication process more self-consistent (also lowers the chance of getting order of filters wrong)
    - Requires the filter parameters "trustore" and "trustorePassword" to be set on the AuthenticationFilter instead of the AuthorizationFilter.
    - If the SAML authentication cookie is found and succesfully parsed, the use openid identity is saved at request scope as the value of
      the attribute named "esg.openid" - can be retrieved by any downstream component including the metrics filter.
