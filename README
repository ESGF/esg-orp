This package contains the ESG OpenidRelyingParty (ORP) web application, which can be used to secure a generic data application server
running in a Tomcat container in conjunction with the ESG access control filters, and any Openid Identity Provider.

By default, the application is configured to use a self-signed example keystore located in the classpath as esg/keystore-localhost
(a corresponding example trustore containing that certificate is available as WEB-INF/jssecacerts). 
It is highly recommended to obtain or generate a keystore specific to your application, 
and to configure the ORP application to use it by changing the property file esg/application.properties 
(a corresponding trustore must also be generated to be used by the data application server).

When deployed on localhost, the default application URL is: https://localhost:8443/OpenidRelyingParty/ .

Note that by default the application writes out very verbose logs to facilitate debugging in early deployment. 
These settings can be changed in the file WEB-ING/log4j.xml

OpenSAML requires an xml parser that supports JAXP 1.3 and DOM3.
The JVM is currently configured to use the Sun XML parser, which is known
to be buggy and can not be used with OpenSAML.  Please endorse a functional
JAXP library(ies) such as Xerces and Xalan.  For instructions on how to endorse
a new parser see http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/standards/index.html
